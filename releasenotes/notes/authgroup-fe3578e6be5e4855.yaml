    Adding ``--authgroup`` argument from OpenConnect

    Some VPN endpoints require users to post a valid authgroup (in OpenConnect
    lingua) as part of the ``group-access`` xml node. Up until now it was only
    possible to override the authgroup from the configuration or from an
    AnyConnect XML profile.
